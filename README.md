# BusReservationSystem

- The project implements a basic bus reservation system using a class structure and provides functionality for managing bus information and seat reservations through a menu-driven interface.

- The code utilizes a class called 'a' to represent buses and their related information. It includes functions to install bus information, make seat reservations, display bus details, and check available buses.

- The main function serves as the user interface by presenting a menu driven system. Users can select options to perform various actions like installing bus information, reserving seats, viewing bus details, and checking available buses.

- The code uses arrays and loops to manage seat reservations and availability. It prompts the user for inputs, validates them, and updates the seat status accordingly. It also provides functions to display the details of a specific bus, including the reserved seats, and lists the available buses
